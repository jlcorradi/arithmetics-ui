# Arithmetics UI
This project entails the development of a straightforward application. It has been created as part of an assignment for
the role of Java Developer at an undisclosed company.

## To improve
- i18n - Support for multiple languages
- Custom validation instead of HTML5 Validations
- Date Picker instead of HTML5 date

## Proposal

The central idea revolves around crafting a platform dedicated to providing fundamental arithmetic computations. These
include Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Square Root calculations, as well as the generation of Random
Strings.

## Requirements
- docker and docker-compose
- node v16 or later

## Running the Application

### Running locally
In order to run the application locally you need to update the file ```setupProxy.js``` to configure a reverse proxy
when making requests to the backend to avoid CORS issues.
